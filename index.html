        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel i got
        every penny's worth.

        "I was the EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
        it incredibly fun! I enrollled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
        the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course,
        I've have completely switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at
        a VR startup."

        Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.

        "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find
        really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be

        developer. The standard is above the rest.You will get the personal
        attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing

        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a fromer student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        perticular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I've referred to it during
        interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple
        offers. 100% recommended!
